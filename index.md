# Data Science Project
  <hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#333;" />

## NLP Application
  * Capstone project of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) at John Hopkins
  * Used R, R-libraries (Rweka, tm) and RShiny
  * Dataset provided by [Swiftkey](http://www.swiftkey.com), a keyboard developer for Android
  * The tool uses N-grams to calculated the [next] most-likely word when typing
  * The project is shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/a-azad/NLP-typing-application) and the tool is live [here](https://delgraph.shinyapps.io/MyApp/)

## Ensemble Based [Data Assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation)
  * Application of [Ensemble Kalman Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Kalman_filter) in system training
  * The algorithm was used to predict oil production (time series)
  * Real-time model improvement using new observation
  * Showed significant value in production forecasting
  * Data pipeline and automation in Bash; coded in MATLAB
  * Codes and more information shared on [Github](https://github.com/a-azad/Ensemble-Based-Forecasting)

## Geospatial Machine Learning ([Geostatistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostatistics))
  * Application of geospatial modeling in Earth Sciences
  * Two independent rock properties modeled using a 3D regression model called Krigging
  * Coded in [GSLIB](http://www.gslib.com/), MATLAB and [SGeMS](http://sgems.sourceforge.net/)
  * The algorithm is frequently used in the energy sector to explore unknown subsurface features
  * The code is shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/a-azad/geospatial.modeling)

## Simple Interactive Tool for Kids
  * An interactive web page for kids
  * Coded in R and RShiny
  * It is useful to:
    - Visually learn and practice longitude vs. latitude
    - Understand the concept of randomization
  * The tool is live [here](https://delgraph.shinyapps.io/MyTool/)
